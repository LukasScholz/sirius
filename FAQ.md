## SIRIUS Import/Export
### How can I export result in SIRIUS 4.4 GUI?
SIRIUS 4.4 saves all results and data immediately to disk. This output is a well organized folder structure (project-space). 
If you have not specified any custom location (`SaveAs` button), SIRIUS stores everything in a temporary location per default. 
You can see the path of current project-space location in the header of the SIRIUS window.

## Microsoft Windows
### Is running Java a security problem?
Only if you enable execution of Java programs in your web browser. Today, there is practically
no need to run Java from the browser, so you should disable this option (it
is probably disabled already).  Always keep your JRE up-to-date.

### I want to run SIRIUS on Windows XP!
Don't. Running Windows XP on a computer connected to the internet is a security hazard.
