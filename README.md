Introduction
============

SIRIUS 3 is a *java* library for analyzing metabolites from tandem mass
spectrometry data. It combines the analysis of isotope patterns in MS
spectra with the analysis of fragmentation patterns in MS/MS spectra.

SIRIUS 3 requires **high mass accuracy** data. The mass deviation of
your MS and MS/MS spectra should be within 20 ppm. Mass Spectrometry
instruments like TOF, Orbitrap and FTICR usually provide high mass
accuracy data, as well as coupled instruments like Q-TOF, IT-TOF or
IT-Orbitrap. However, spectra measured with a quadrupole do not provide
the high mass accuracy that is necessary for our method.

SIRIUS expects **MS and MS/MS** spectra as input. Although it is
possible to omit the MS data, it will make the analysis much more time
consuming and might give you worse results.

SIRIUS expects **processed peak lists**. It does not contain routines
for peak picking from profiled spectra nor routines for merging spectra
in an LC/MS run. There are several tools specialized for this task, e.g.
XCMS or MZmine.

The main purpose of SIRIUS is to identify the molecular formula of the
measured ion. Beside this, the software also annotates the spectrum
providing a molecular formula for each fragment peak as well as
detecting noise peaks. A **fragmentation tree** is predicted. This tree
contains the predicted fragmentation reaction leading to the fragment
peaks.

SIRIUS does not identify the (2D or 3D) structure of compounds, nor does
it look up compounds in databases. There are other tools for this
purpose, e.g. CSI:FingerId, MetFrag, CFM, and MAGMa.

SIRIUS can be used within an analysis pipeline. For example you can
identify the molecular formula of the ion and the fragment peaks and use
this information as input for other tools like FingerID or MAGMa to
identify the 2D structure of the measured compound. For this purpose you
can also use the SIRIUS library directly, instead of the command line
interface. See SIRIUS Java Library.

Since Sirius 3.1 our software ships with an **user interface**. The user
interface, however, have to be downloaded separately. If you want to use
an user interface, use the file **SiriusGUI.exe** instead of sirius.exe.

Modelling the fragmentation process as tree comes with some flaws:
Namely **pull-ups** and **parallelograms**. A pull-up is a fragment
which is inserted too deep into the trees. Due to our combinatorial
model SIRIUS will always try to generate very deep trees, claiming that
there are many small fragmentation steps instead of few larger ones.
SIRIUS will for example prefer three consecuting C2H2 losses to a single
C6H6 loss. This does not affect the quality of the molecular formula
identification. But when interpreting fragmentation trees you should
keep this side-effect of the optimization in mind. **Parallelograms**
are consecutive fragmentation processes that might happen in different
orders. SIRIUS will always decide for one order of this fragmentation
reactions, as this is the only valid way to model the fragmentation as
tree.

Installation
============

User Interface
--------------

SIRIUS should hopefully work out of the box. You just have to install a
java runtime environment (version &gt;= 7). If you have a 64 bit
operating system you also have to install a 64 bit java runtime!

Windows
-------

The sirius3-console.exe as well as Sirius3-gui.exe should hopefully work
out of the box. To execute the SIRIUS commandline tool from every
location you have to add the location of the sirius.exe to your PATH
environment variable.

Linux and MacOSX
----------------

With SIRIUS 3.2 we deliver all necessary third-party dependencies with
SIRIUS.

To execute SIRIUS from every location you have to add the location of
the sirius executable to your PATH variable. Open the file "\~/.bashrc"
in an editor and add the following line (replacing the placeholder
path):

> export PATH=\$PATH:/path/to/sirius

Gurobi
------

SIRIUS ships with the GLPK solver which is fast enough in most cases.
However, if you want to analyze large molecules and spectra with lot of
peaks, you can greatly improve the running time by using a more
efficient solver. Next go GLPK we also support the Gurobi \[1\] solver.
This is a commercial solver which offers a free academic licence for
university members. You can find the installation instruction for Gurobi
on their website. SIRIUS will automatically use Gurobi als solver if the
environment variables for the library path (PATH on windows,
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH on linux, DYLIB\_LIBRARY\_PATH on MacOSX) are set to
the lib directory of your gurobi installation and if the environment
variable GUROBI\_HOME is set to your gurobi installation location.
Gurobi will greatly improve the speed of the computation. Beside this
there will be no differences in using Gurobi or GLPK.

User Interface
==============

With Sirius 3.1 our software ships with an user interface. Please be
aware that the user interface have to be downloaded separately from the
commandline tool. Take sure that you downloaded a file named
SiriusGUI.exe.

> \[image\]

Overview
--------

On top of the screen you find the toolbar(1). On the left side is the
experiment list (2) displaying all imported experiments. An experiment
describes the set of MS and MS/MS spectra corresponding to a single
measured compound. If an experiment is successfully computed you will
see a tick mark on the right (3); if something goes wrong during
computation you will see a cross symbol (4). The output of a computation
is an ordered list of suggested molecular formula candidates. After
selecting an experiment in the experiment list the candidate list (5)
should display all molecular formula candidates together with their
score. When selecting a candidate, the tree viewer (6) displays the
computed fragmentation tree. Nodes in the tree are colored according to
their score.

Data Import
-----------

Sirius offers two modes for data import: **Single Import** and **Batch
Import**. The Single Import is triggered when clicking on the *Import*
button in the toolbar. It allows you to import **one** experiment. We
will use the term experiment as a description of MS and MS/MS spectra
belonging to a single compound. The Single Import mode is recommended if
your data consists of several csv (comma separated values) files (like
the data from the CASMI challenges). First press on *Import* to start
the import dialog.

> \[image\]

For each spectrum you have to select the MS level (either MS 1 or MS 2).
If you have MSn spectra you can just import them as MS 2 spectra. You
can select a name for the experiment as well as an ionization mode. The
collision energy is an optional attribute as it does not affect the
computation.

You can import *.ms* and *.mgf* files using the *Batch Import*. In this
mode Sirius will read all attributes (MS level, ionization, parentmass)
directly from the file. You can, however, change these attributes
afterwards by selecting the imported experiment and clicking on the
**Edit** button.

See section *Supported Input Formats* for a description of the file
formats *.ms* and *.mgf*.

### Drag and Drop

Sirius supports Drag and Drop: Just move your input files into the
application window. This is usually the easiest way to import data into
Sirius. Supported file formats for Drag and Drop are *.csv*, *.ms*,
*.sirius* and *.mgf*.

Identifying Molecular Formulas with SIRIUS
------------------------------------------

As for importing data Sirius offers two computation modes: **Single
Computation** and **Batch Computation**. The Single Computation allows
you to setup different parameters for each experiment. You can trigger
it by right-clicking on an experiment and choosing **Compute** in the
context menu. The Batch Computation will run in background and compute
all experiments in the workspace.

> \[image\]

### parent mass

The exact m/z of the parent peak. If MS 1 data is present, the m/z of
the monoisotopic peak is presented as default. Otherwise, an
autocompletion offers a list of high intensive peaks from the MS 2
spectra.

### elements besides CHNOPS

Sirius will use the elements carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N),
oxygen (O), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) by default. Additional
elements can be selected in the checkboxes. Adding elements that do not
occur in the correct molecular formula of the compound will usually not
lead to wrong results but to an increased running time of the algorithm.

### other

The ionization mode determines the polarity of the measurement (positive
or negative) as well as the adduct (e.g. protonation or sodium adduct).
If you choose **Unknown Positive** or **Unknown Negative** Sirius will
not care about the adduct, but report the molecular formula of the
**ion** in the candidate list. Otherwise, Sirius will subtract the
adducts formula from the ions formula and report neutral molecular
formulas in the candidate list as well as in the fragmentation trees.

Choose either *Q-TOF*, *Orbitrap* or *FT-ICR* in the instrument field.
The chosen instrument affects only very few parameters of the method
(mainly the allowed mass deviation). If your instrument is not one of
these three then just select the Q-TOF instrument.

You can change the maximal allowed mass deviation in the **ppm** field.
Sirius will only consider molecular formulas which mass deviations are
either below the chosen ppm or smaller than frac{100 cdot
ppm\_{max}}{10\^6}

Finally, you can select the number of molecular formula candidates that
should be given in the output as well as where they come from.

If you select **All possible molecular formulas** then SIRIUS will
enumerate over all molecular formulas that match the ion mass, filtering
out only molecular formulas with negative ring double bond equivalent.
If you choose **PubChem formulas** then SIRIUS will select all molecular
formulas from PubChem. When choosing **formulas from biological
databases** SIRIUS will select formulas that are contained in any
database of either biological compounds or compounds that could be
expected in biological experiments (e.g. KEGG, Biocyc, HMDB but also
MaConDa).

Please consider the following:

:   -   we never search in any of these databases but instead in our own
        in-house database. Although we regularly update our database it
        might happen that some new compound in e.g. CHEBI is not already
        contained in our own copy of CHEBI.
    -   when choosing a database SIRIUS will ignore your element
        restrictions and instead allow all elements. However, if you
        provide MS1 spectra SIRIUS can usually determine the elemental
        composition from them anyways.
    -   while we recommend searching in PubChem and filtering the
        results afterwards, searching in bio databases significantly
        speeds up the computation, as SIRIUS has to consider much less
        molecular formulas and have to download much smaller candidate
        structure lists.

Identifying Molecular Structure with CSI:FingerId
-------------------------------------------------

After computing the fragmentation trees you can search these in a
structure database. Again we provide a **single mode** and a **batch
mode**. The single mode is available by clicking on the molecular
formula of interest, then switching to the **CSI:FingerId** tab and
pressing on the **Search online with CSI:FingerId** button. The batch
mode can be triggered by pressing on the **CSI:FingerId** in the
toolbar.

> \[image\]

When starting the CSI:FingerId search you are again asked to choose
between PubChem or biological databases. This is mainly a performance
issue because you can filter your result lists afterwards by any
database you want to. Our biological database is several magnitudes
smaller than PubChem and downloading and searching structure lists from
biological databases is significantly faster. However, when searching in
biological databases you might never see if there are structures with
possibly much better score from PubChem. Therefore, we recommend to
search in PubChem and filter the result list if you expect the result to
be contained in biological databases.

Visualization of the Results
----------------------------

The candidate list displays the best candidate molecular formulas
ordered by score. Molecular formulas are always written in neutral form,
except for compounds with unknown ionization mode. For every molecular
formula the corresponding fragmentation tree is visualized in the „tree
view“ tab. Alternatively, the „spectra view“ tab visualizes which peak
is assigned to a fragment.

### Tree View

> \[image\]

The tree view displays the estimated Fragmentation Tree. Each node in
this tree assigns a molecular formula to a peak in the (merged) MS 2
spectrum. Each edge is a hypothetical fragmentation reaction. The user
has the choice between different node styles and color schemes. The
shown tree can be exported as JPEG, GIF, and PNG. Alternatively, the Dot
file format contains only a description of the tree. It can be used to
render the tree externally. The command-line tool Graphviz can transform
dot files into image formats (PDF, SVG, PNG etc). The JSON format yields
a machine-readable representation of the tree.

### Spectrum View

> \[image\]

In the spectrum view all peaks that are annotated by the Fragmentation
Tree are colored in blue. Peaks that are annotated as noise are colored
black. Hovering with the mouse over a peak shows its annotation.

### CSI:FingerId View

> \[image\]

This tab shows you the candidate structures for the selected molecular
formula ordered by the CSI:FingerId search score. If you want to filter
the candidate list by a certain database (e.g. only compounds from KEGG
and Biocyc) you can press the filter button. A menu will open displaying
all available databases. Only candidates will be displayed that are
enabled in this filter menu. Note that PubChem is enabled by default
and, therefore, always the complete list is shown. If you want to see
only compounds from KEGG and Biocyc you have to disable PubChem and
enable KEGG and Biocyc.

Another way of filtering is the XLogP slider. If you have information
about retention times and expected logP values of your measured compound
you can use this slider to filter the candidate list by certain XLogP
values. The slider allows you to define min and max values. XLogP is
calculated using the CDK development kit \[1\].

The green and red squares are some visualization of the CSI:FingerId
predictions and scoring. All green squares represent molecular
structures that are found in the candidate structure and are predicted
by CSI:FingerId to be present in the measured compound. As lighter the
square as more likely is the predicted probability for the presence of
this substructure. As larger the square as more reliable is the
predictor. The red squares, however, represent structures that are
predicted to be absent but are, nevertheless, found in the candidate
structure. Again, as lighter the square as higher the predicted
probability that this structure should be absent. Therefore, a lot of
large light green squares and as few as possible large light red squares
are a good indication for a correct prediction.

When hovering with the mouse over these squares the corresponding
description of the molecular structure (usually a SMART expression) is
displayed. When clicking on one of these squares, the corresponding
atoms in the molecule that belong to this substructure are highlighted.
If the substructure matches several times in the molecule, it is once
highlighted in dark blue while all other matches are highlighted in a
translucent blue.

Even if the correct structure is not found by CSI:FingerId -especially
if the correct structure is not contained in any database -you can get
information about the structure by looking at the predicted structures:
When clicking on the large light green squares you see which molecular
substructures are expected in the measured compound.

You can open a context menu by right click on the compound. It offers
you to open the compound in PubChem or copy the InChI or InChI key in
your clipboard.

If the compound is contained in any biological database, a blue label
with the name of this database is displayed below the compound. You can
click on most of these labels to open the database entry in your browser
window.

You can export a single candidate list by clicking on the **export
list** button.

Workspace
---------

All imported experiments together with their results (the candidate
molecular formulas and corresponding fragmentation trees) form the
**workspace**. You can save the workspace into a file by clicking on
**Save Workspace** in the toolbar. Analogously, you can load a workspace
using **Load Workspace**. The workspace is saved in the **.sirius**
format, which is simply a Zip Archive containing the input spectra and
fragmentation trees. You can share the *.sirius* files with other
people. But be aware that the input spectra are contained in these
files!

The Sirius Commandline Tool is able to output *.sirius* files by using
the option **-O sirius**. You can import these files with the Sirius
User Interface to get a visualization of the results.

Currently, CSI:FingerId predictions are not stored in the *.sirius*
file. This will hopefully change in future releases.

### Export Results

Next to the *.sirius* format you can also export your results as a
simple **csv** file by clicking on the **Export Results** button. Such a
*csv* file can then be imported into *Excel*, *Matlab* or *R*.

The csv file contains the following fields:

:   -   name of the experiment
    -   parent mass
    -   ionization
    -   for each molecular formula candidate there are two columns: one
        with the molecular formula and one with the corresponding score

If the number of molecular formula candidates differ between
experiments, the number of fields per row might differ, too. However,
most software programs do not have a problem with such *malformed* csv
files.

### Confidence View

When identifying large amounts of spectra with CSI:FingerId you will,
unfortunately, get a lot of wrong predictions among the correct ones.
With SIRIUS 3.2 we offer a confidence score that reflects the likelihood
that some identification is correct. You can list all identifications by
opening the **identification** tab.

> \[image\]

This list contains the top hits in all structure candidate lists ordered
by their confidence. Entries at the top are more likely to be correct
while entries at the bottom are more likely to be wrong.

Example Workflow
----------------

### Working in Single Mode

### Identifying a CASMI challenge

1.  Download the files <http://casmi->
    contest.org/2014/Challenge2014/Challenge1/1\_MS.txt and http
    ://casmi-contest.org/2014/Challenge2014/Challenge1/1\_MSMS.txt
2.  Move these files via Drag and Drop into the application window
3.  Change the ms level of the first file into *Ms 1*
4.  Click on *Ok*
5.  Click on *Compute* in the right-click context menu of the imported
    experiment
6.  Choose *Q-TOF* as instrument and press the *Ok* button
7.  *C23H46NO7P* should be suggested as number one hit in the candidate
    list

SIRIUS Commandline Tool
=======================

The SIRIUS commandline tool can be either called via the binary by
simply running the command "sirius" in your commandline. Alternatively,
you can run the sirius jar file using java with the command:

> java -jar sirius.jar

You can always use the "--help" option to get a documentation about the
available commands and options. Assuming you want to analyze the example
data given in the CASMI \[2\] contest, you would execute the following
on the commandline:

> sirius -1 MSpos\_Challenge0.txt -2 MSMSpos\_Challenge0.txt

Supported Input Formats
-----------------------

### Mass Spectra

The input of SIRIUS are MS and MS/MS spectra as simple peak lists.
SIRIUS can read csv files which contain on each line a m/z and an
intensity value separated by either a whitespace, a comma or a TAB
character. For example:

> 185.041199 4034.674316 203.052597 12382.624023 245.063171 50792.085938
> 275.073975 124088.046875 305.084106 441539.125 335.094238 4754.061035
> 347.09494 13674.210938 365.105103 55487.472656

The intensity values can be arbitrary floating point values. SIRIUS will
transform the intensities into relative intensities, so only the ratio
between the intensity values is important.

SIRIUS also supports the mgf (mascot generic format). This file format
was developed for peptide spectra for the mascot search engine. Each
spectrum in a mgf file can contain many spectra each starting with
"BEGIN IONS" and ending with "END IONS". Peaks are again written as
pairs of m/z and intensity values separated by whitespaces with one peak
per line. Further meta information can be given as NAME=VALUE pairs.
SIRIUS recognizes the following meta information:

> -   PEPMASS: contains the measured mass of the ion (e.g. the
>     parent peak)
> -   CHARGE: contains the charge of the ion. As SIRIUS supports only
>     single charged ions, this value can be either 1+ or 1-.
> -   MSLEVEL: should be 1 for MS spectra and 2 for MS/MS spectra.
>     SIRIUS will treat higher values automatically as MS/MS spectra,
>     although, it might be that it supports MSn spectra in
>     future versions.

This is an example for a mgf file:

> BEGIN IONS PEPMASS=438.32382 CHARGE=1+ MSLEVEL=2 185.041199
> 4034.674316 203.052597 12382.624023 245.063171 50792.085938 275.073975
> 124088.046875 305.084106 441539.125 335.094238 4754.061035 347.09494
> 13674.210938 365.105103 55487.472656 END IONS

See also the GNPS \[1\] database for other examples of mgf files.

A disadvantage of these data formats is that they do not contain all
information necessary for SIRIUS to perform the computation. Missing
meta information have to be provided via the commandline. Therefore,
SIRIUS supports also an own file format very similar to the mgf format
above. The file ending of this format is **.ms**. Each file contains one
measured compound (but arbitrary many spectra). Each line may contain a
peak (given as m/z and intensity separated by a whitespace), meta
information (starting with the **&gt;** symbol followed by the
information type, a whitespace and the value) or comments (starting with
the **\#** symbol). The following fields are recognized by SIRIUS:

-   &gt;compound: The name of the measured compound (or any
    placeholder). This field is **mandatory**.
-   &gt;parentmass: the mass of the parent peak
-   &gt;formula: The molecular formula of the compound. This information
    is helpful if you already know the correct molecular formula and
    just want to compute a tree or recalibrate the spectrum
-   &gt;ion: the ionization mode. See Ion Modes for the format of
    ion modes.
-   &gt;charge: is redundant if you already provided the ion mode.
    Otherwise, it gives the charge of the ion (1 or -1).
-   &gt;ms1: All peaks after this line are interpreted as MS peaks
-   &gt;ms2: All peaks after this line are interpreted as MS/MS peaks
-   &gt;collision: The same as &gt;ms2 with the difference that you can
    provide a collision energy

An example for a .ms file:

> &gt;compound Gentiobiose &gt;formula C12H22O11 &gt;ionization
> \[M+Na\]+ &gt;parentmass 365.10544
>
> &gt;ms1 365.10543 85.63 366.10887 11.69 367.11041 2.67

#### Ion Modes

Whenever SIRIUS requires the ion mode, it should be given in the
following format:

> \[M+ADDUCT\]+ for positive ions \[M+ADDUCT\]- for negative ions
> \[M-ADDUCT\]- for losses \[M\]+ for instrinsically charged compounds

ADDUCT is the molecular formula of the adduct. The most common
ionization modes are "\[M+H\]+", "\[M+Na\]+", "\[M-H\]-", "\[M+Cl\]-".
Currently, SIRIUS supports only single-charged compounds, so
"\[M+2H\]2+" is not valid. For intrinsic charged compounds "\[M\]+" and
"\[M\]-" should be used.

#### Molecular Formulas

Molecular Formulas in SIRIUS must not contain brackets. So "2(C2H2)" is
not a valid molecular formula. Write "C4H4" instead. Furthermore, all
molecular formulas in SIRIUS are always neutral, there is no possibility
to add a charge on a molecular formula (instead, charges are given
separately). So "CH3+" is not a valid molecular formula. Write "CH3"
instead and provide the charge separately via commandline option.

#### Chemical Alphabets

Whenever SIRIUS requires the chemical alphabet, you have to provide
which elements should be considered and what is the maximum amount for
each element. Chemical alphabets are written like molecular formulas.
The maximum amount of an element is written in square brackets behind
the element. If no square brackets are given, the element might occur
arbitrary often. The standard alphabet is CHNOP\[5\]S, allowing the
elements C, H, N O and S as well as up to five times the element P.

##### Identifying Molecular Formulas

The main purpose of SIRIUS is identifying the molecular formula of the
measured ion. The syntax for this command is:

> sirius \[OPTIONS\] -z &lt;PARENTMASS&gt; -i &lt;IONIZATION&gt; -1
> &lt;MS FILE&gt; -2 &lt;MS/MS FILE&gt;

Where MS FILE and MS/MS FILE are either csv or mgf files. If mgf files
are used, you might omit the PARENTMASS option. If you omit the
IONIZATION option, \[M+H\]+ is used as default. It is also possible to
give a list of MS/MS files if you have several measurements of the same
compound with different collision energies. SIRIUS will merge these
MS/MS spectra into one spectrum.

If your input files are in *.ms* or *.mgf* format (containing MSLEVEL
and PEPMASS meta information), you can omit the -1 and -2 flag. For
example:

> sirius \[OPTIONS\] demo-data/ms

SIRIUS will pick the meta information (parentmass, ionization etc.) from
the *.ms* files in the given directory. This allows SIRIUS to run in
batch mode (analyzing multiple compounds without starting a new jvm
process every time).

SIRIUS will output a candidate list containing the **rank**, **overall
score**, **fragmentation pattern score**, **isotope pattern score**, the
number of **explained peaks** and the relative amount of **explained
intensity**. See the following example output:

> sirius -z 354.1347 -p orbitrap -1 demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_ms.txt
>
> :   -2 demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms1.txt
>     demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms2.txt
>
> 1.) C20H19NO5 score: 33.17 tree: +27.48 iso: 5.69 peaks: 13 95.44 %
> 2.) C16H22N2O5P score: 32.35 tree: +26.77 iso: 5.58 peaks: 13 95.44 %
> 3.) C12H23N3O7S score: 24.62 tree: +24.62 iso: 0.00 peaks: 13 95.44 %
> 4.) C18H17N4O4 score: 23.28 tree: +23.28 iso: 0.00 peaks: 14 95.79 %
> 5.) C14H20N5O4P score: 21.61 tree: +21.61 iso: 0.00 peaks: 14 95.79 %

The overall score is the sum of the fragmentation pattern score and the
isotope pattern score. If the isotope pattern score is negative, it is
set to zero. If at least one isotope pattern score is greater than 10,
the isotope pattern is considered to have *good quality* and only the
candidates with best isotope pattern scores are selected for further
fragmentation pattern analysis.

If you want to analyze spectra measured with Orbitrap or FTICR, you
should specify the appropiated analysis profile. A profile is a set of
configuration options and scoring functions SIRIUS will use for its
analysis. For example, the Orbitrap and FTICR profiles having tighter
constraints for the allowed mass deviation but do not rely so much on
the intensity of isotope peaks. You can set the profile with the "-p
&lt;name&gt;" option. By default, qtof is used as profile.

SIRIUS recognizes the following options:

-p &lt;name&gt;, --profile &lt;name&gt;

> Specify the used analysis profile. Choose either **qtof**,
> **orbitrap** or **fticr**. By default, **qtof** is selected.

-o &lt;dirname&gt;, --output &lt;dirname&gt;

> Specify the output directory. If given, SIRIUS will write the computed
> trees into this directory.

-O &lt;format&gt;, --format &lt;format&gt;

> Specify the format of the output of the fragmentation trees. This can
> be either **json** (machine readable), **dot** (visualizable) or
> **sirius** (can be viewed with the Sirius User Interface).

-f \[list of formulas\], --formula \[list of formulas\]

> Specify a list of candidate formulas (separated by whitespaces) that
> should be considered during analysis. This option is helpful if you
> performed a database search beforehand and only want to consider
> molecular formulas found in the database. It is recommendet to first
> consider all molecular formulas (and omit this option) and filter the
> candidate list afterwards. However, specifying a subset of molecular
> formulas with this option might greatly improve the speed of the
> analysis especially for large molecules.

-a, --annotate

> If set, SIRIUS will write the annotated spectrum containing the
> explanations (molecular formulas) for all identified peaks in a csv
> file within the specified output directory.

-c &lt;num&gt;, --candidates &lt;num&gt;

> The number of candidates in the output. By default, SIRIUS will only
> write the five best candidates.

-s &lt;val&gt;, --isotope &lt;val&gt;

> This option specifies the way SIRIUS will handle the isotope patterns.
> If it is set to **omit**, SIRIUS will omit the isotope pattern
> analysis. If it is set to **filter**, SIRIUS will use the isotope
> pattern to select a subset of candidates before starting the
> fragmentation pattern analysis (this will improve the speed of the
> analysis). Only if it is set to **score**, SIRIUS will use it for
> filtering and scoring the candidates. The default setting is
> **score**.

-e &lt;alphabet&gt;, --elements &lt;alphabet&gt;

> Specify the used chemical alphabet. See Chemical Alphabets. By
> default, "CHNOP\[5\]S" is used.

-i &lt;ion&gt;, --ion &lt;ion&gt;

> Specify the used ionization. See Ion Modes. By default, "\[M+H\]+" is
> used.

-z &lt;mz&gt;, --parentmass &lt;mz&gt;

> Specify the parentmass of the input spectra. You have to give the
> exact measured value, not the selected ion mass.

-1 &lt;file&gt;, --ms1 &lt;file&gt;

> Specify the file path to the MS spectrum of the measured compound.

-2 &lt;file&gt;, --ms2 &lt;file&gt;

> Specify one or multiple file paths to the MS/MS spectra of the
> measured compound

--ppm-max &lt;value&gt;

> Specify the allowed mass deviation of the fragment peaks in ppm. By
> default, Q-TOF instruments use 10 ppm and Orbitrap instruments use 5
> ppm.

--auto-charge

> If this option is set, SIRIUS will annotate the fragment peaks with
> ion formulas instead of neutral molecular formulas. Use this option if
> you do not know the correct ionization.

--no-recalibrate

> If this option is set, SIRIUS will not recalibrate the spectrum during
> the analysis.

--fingerid

> If this option is set, SIRIUS will search for molecular structure
> using CSI:FingerId after determining the molecular formula

--database, -d

> If this option is set, SIRIUS will only consider molecular formulas
> from the given database. Either "PubChem" or "bio" can be chosen, as
> well as other concrete databases like "hmdb", "kegg",
> "knapsack`` `or ``biocyc". When used with the option --fingerid, the

> -i \[M+H\]+ -1 ms.csv -2 msms.csv

##### Computing Fragmentation Trees

If you already know the correct molecular formula and just want to
compute a tree, you can specify a single molecular formula with the "-f"
option. SIRIUS will then only compute a tree for this molecular formula.
If your input data is in ".ms" format, the molecular formula might be
already specified within the file. If a molecular formula is specified,
the parentmass can be omitted. However, you still have to specify the
ionization (except for default value "\[M+H\]+"):

> sirius -f C20H19NO5 -2 demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms2.txt
> demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms2.txt

##### Visualizing Fragmentation Trees

SIRIUS supports three output formats for fragmentation trees: dot
(graphviz format), json (machine readable format), and sirius (can be
viewed with the Sirius User Interface). The commandline tool Graphviz
\[3\] can transform dot files into image formats (pdf, svg, png etc.).
After installing Graphviz you can display tree files as follows:

> sirius -p orbitrap -f C20H17NO6 -o trees demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms
> dot -Tpdf -O trees/Bicuculline.dot

This creates a file Bicuculline.dot.pdf (Fig.1). Remark that SIRIUS uses
automatically the file name of the input spectrum to name the output
file. You can specify another filename with the **-o** option (as long
as only one tree is computed).

> sirius -p orbitrap -f C20H17NO6 -o compound.dot
> demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms dot -Tpdf -O compound.dot
>
> \[image\]The output of the dot program to visualize the computed
> fragmentation tree

##### Identifying Molecular Structures

With SIRIUS 3.2 you can also search for molecular structures with
CSI:FingerId. Just add the option **--fingerid** to trigger a
CSI:FingerId search after fragmentation tree computation. With
**--database** can now also specify the database SIRIUS should search
in. Available are *pubchem* and *bio*. However, you can also specify
certain databases like *kegg* and *hmdb*, although it is recommended to
filter the list afterwards.

SIRIUS will generate csv files for each input spectrum containing a
ordered candidate list of structures with the CSI:FingerId score.
Furthermore, another result csv file is generated only the top
candidates from all input spectra ordered by their confidence.

> sirius -c 10 --database=pubchem --fingerid demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms

##### Demo Data

You can download some sample spectra from the SIRIUS website at
<http://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/sirius2/wp->
content/uploads/2015/05/demo.zip

The demo-data contain examples for three different data formats readable
by SIRIUS. The mgf folder contain an example for a mgf file containing a
single compound with several MS/MS spectra measured on an Orbitrap
instrument. SIRIUS recognizes that these MS/MS spectra belong to the
same compound because they have the same parent mass. To analyze this
compound, run:

> sirius -p orbitrap demo-data/mgf/laudanosine.mgf

The output is:

> 1.) C21H27NO4 score: 25.41 tree: +17.55 iso: 7.86 peaks: 12 97.94 %
> 2.) C17H30N2O4P score: 21.46 tree: +13.97 iso: 7.49 peaks: 12 97.94 %
> 3.) C15H28N5O3P score: 15.00 tree: +15.00 iso: 0.00 peaks: 11 87.04 %
> 4.) C19H25N4O3 score: 14.66 tree: +14.66 iso: 0.00 peaks: 11 87.16 %
> 5.) C14H27N7O2S score: 13.69 tree: +13.69 iso: 0.00 peaks: 11 97.38 %

This is a ranking list of the top molecular formula candidates. The best
candidate is C21H27NO4 with a overall score of 25.41. This score is the
sum of the fragmentation pattern scoring (17.55) and the isotope pattern
scoring (7.86). For the last three candidates, the isotope pattern
scoring is 0. In fact, this score can never fall below zero. If all
isotope pattern scores are zero, you can assume that the isotope pattern
has very low quality and cannot be used to determine the molecular
formula. If the isotope pattern score of the top candidate is over 10,
it is assumed to be a high quality isotope pattern. In this case, the
isotope pattern is also used to filter out unlikely candidates and speed
up the analysis.

The last two columns contain the number of explained peaks in MS/MS
spectrum as well as the relative amount of explained intensity. The last
value should usually be over 80 % or even 90 %. If this value is very
low you either have strange high intensive noise in your spectrum or the
allowed mass deviation might be too low to explain all the peaks.

If you want to look at the trees, you have to add the output option:

> sirius -p orbitrap -o outputdir demo-data/mgf/laudanosine.mgf

Now, SIRIUS will write the computed trees into the *outputdir*
directory. You can visualize this trees in pdf format using Graphviz:

> dot -Tpdf -O outputdir/laudanosine\_1\_C21H27NO4.dot

This creates a pdf file *outputdir/laudanosine\_1\_C21H27NO4.dot.pdf*.

The directory *ms* contains two examples of the ms format. Each file
contains a single compound measured with an Orbitrap instrument. To
analyze this compound run:

> sirius -p orbitrap -o outputdir demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms

As the ms file already contains the correct molecular formula, SIRIUS
will directly compute the tree. For such cases (as well as when you
specify exactly one molecular formula via *-f* option) you can also
specify the concrete filename of the output file:

> sirius -p orbitrap -o mycompound.dot demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms

If you want to enforce a molecular formula analysis and ranking
(although the correct molecular formula is given within the file) you
can specify the number of candidates with the *-c* option:

> sirius -p orbitrap -c 5 demo-data/ms/Bicuculline.ms

SIRIUS will now ignore the correct molecular formula in the file and
output the 5 best candidates.

The txt folder contains simple peaklist files. Such file formats can be
easily extracted from Excel spreadsheets. However, they do not contain
meta information like the MS level and the parent mass. So you have to
specify this information via commandline options:

> sirius -p orbitrap -z 354.134704589844 -1 demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_ms.txt
>
> :   -2 demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms1.txt
>     demo-data/txt/chelidonine\_msms2.txt
>
The demo data contain a clean MS spectrum (e.g. there is only one
isotope pattern contained in the MS spectrum). In such cases, SIRIUS can
infer the correct parent mass from the MS data (by simply using the
monoisotopic mass of the isotope pattern as parent mass). So you can
omit the *-z* option in this cases.

SIRIUS Java Library
===================

You can integrate the SIRIUS library in your java project, either by
using Maven \[1\] or by including the jar file directly. The latter is
not recommendet, as the SIRIUS jar contains also dependencies to other
external libraries.

Maven Integration
-----------------

Add the following repository to your pom file:

> &lt;distributionManagement&gt;
>
> :   
>
>     &lt;repository&gt;
>
>     :   &lt;id&gt;bioinf-jena&lt;/id&gt;
>         &lt;name&gt;bioinf-jena-releases&lt;/name&gt;
>         &lt;url&gt;<http://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/artifactory/libs-releases-local>&lt;/url&gt;
>
>     &lt;/repository&gt;
>
> &lt;/distributionManagement&gt;

Now you can integrate SIRIUS in your project by adding the following
dependency:

> &lt;dependency&gt;
>
> :   &lt;groupId&gt;de.unijena.bioinf&lt;/groupId&gt;
>     &lt;artifactId&gt;SiriusCLI&lt;/artifactId&gt;
>     &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
>
> &lt;/dependency&gt;

Main API
--------

The main class in SIRIUS is **de.unijena.bioinf.sirius.Sirius**. It is
basically a wrapper around the important functionalities of the library.
Although there are special classes for all parts of the analysis
pipeline it is recommended to only use the Sirius class as the API of
all other classes might change in future releases. The Sirius class also
provides factory methods for the most important data structures.
Although, for many of this data structures you could also use their
constructors directly, it is recommended to use the methods in the
Sirius class.

public class Sirius

> The main class in SIRIUS. Provides the basic functionality of the
> method.
>
> Parameters:
>
> :   -   **profile** -- the profile name. Can be one of 'qtof',
>         'orbitrap' or 'fticr'. If ommited, the default
>         profile ('qtof') is used.
>
The main functions of SIRIUS are either identifying the molecular
formula of a given MS/MS experiment or computing a tree for a given
molecular formula and MS/MS spectrum. The Sirius class provides two
methods for this purpose: identify and compute. The basic input type is
an Ms2Experiment. It can be seen as a set of MS/MS spectra derived from
the same precursor as well as a MS spectrum containing this precursor
peak. The output of Sirius is an instance of IdentificationResult,
containing the score and the corresponding fragmentation tree for the
candidate molecular formula.

### Create Datastructures

Sirius provides the following functions to create the basic data
structures:

public Spectrum&lt;Peak&gt; wrapSpectrum(double\[\] mz, double\[\]
intensities)

> Wraps an array of m/z values and and array of intensity values into a
> spectrum object that can be used by the SIRIUS library. The resulting
> spectrum is a lightweight view on the array, so changes in the array
> are reflected in the spectrum. The spectrum object itself is
> immutable.
>
> Parameters:
>
> :   -   **mz** -- mass to charge ratios
>     -   **intensities** -- intensity values. Can be normalized or
>         absolute values - SIRIUS will normalize them itself if
>         necessary
>
> Returns:
>
> :   view on the arrays implementing the Spectrum interface
>
public Element getElement(String symbol)

> Lookup the symbol in the periodic table and returns the corresponding
> Element object or null if no element with this symbol exists.
>
> Parameters:
>
> :   -   **symbol** -- symbol of the element, e.g. H for hydrogen or Cl
>         for chlorine
>
> Returns:
>
> :   instance of Element class
>
public Ionization getIonization(String name)

> Lookup the ionization name and returns the corresponding ionization
> object or null if no ionization with this name is registered. The name

>
> Parameters:
>
> :   -   **name** -- name of the ionization
>
> Returns:
>
> :   Adduct instance
>
public Charge getCharge(int charge)

> Charges are subclasses of Ionization. So they can be used everywhere
> as replacement for ionizations. A charge is very similar to the \[M\]+
> and \[M\]- ionizations. However, the difference is that \[M\]+
> describes an intrinsically charged compound where the Charge +1
> describes an compound with unknown adduct.
>
> Parameters:
>
> :   -   **charge** -- either 1 for positive or -1 for
>         negative charges.
>
> Returns:
>
> :   a Charge instance which is also a subclass of Ionization
>
public Deviation getMassDeviation(int ppm, double abs)

> Creates a Deviation object that describes a mass deviation as maximum
> of a relative term (in ppm) and an absolute term. Usually, mass
> accuracy is given as relative term in ppm, as measurement errors
> increase with higher masses. However, for very small compounds (and
> fragments!) these relative values might overestimate the mass
> accurary. Therefore, an absolute value have to be given.

Changelog
=========

3.1

:   -   Sirius User Interface
    -   new output type **-O sirius**. The .sirius format can be
        imported into the User Interface.
    -   Experimental support for in-source fragmentations and adducts

3.0.3

:   -   fix crash when using GLPK solver

3.0.2

:   -   fix bug: SIRIUS uses the old scoring system by default when -p
        parameter is not given
    -   fix some minor bugs

3.0.1

:   -   if MS1 data is available, SIRIUS will now always use the parent
        peak from MS1 to decompose the parent ion, instead of using the
        peak from an MS/MS spectrum
    -   fix bugs in isotope pattern selection
    -   SIRIUS ships now with the correct version of the GLPK binary

3.0.0

:   -   release version
