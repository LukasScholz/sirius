  ABSTRACT = {Mass spectrometry enables the study of increasingly larger biomolecules with increasingly higher resolution, which is able to distinguish between fine isotopic variants having the same additional nucleon count, but slightly different masses. Therefore, the analysis of the fine isotopic distribution becomes an interesting research topic with important practical applications. In this paper, we propose the comprehensive methodology for studying the basic characteristics of the fine isotopic distribution. Our approach uses a broad spectrum of methods ranging from generating functions--that allow us to estimate the variance and the information theory entropy of the distribution--to the theory of thermal energy fluctuations. Having characterized the variance, spread, shape, and size of the fine isotopic distribution, we are able to indicate limitations to high resolution mass spectrometry. Moreover, the analysis of "thermorelativistic" effects (i.e., mass uncertainty attributable to relativistic effects coupled with the statistical mechanical uncertainty of the energy of an isolated ion), in turn, gives us an estimate of impassable limits of isotopic resolution (understood as the ability to distinguish fine structure peaks), which can be moved further only by cooling the ions. The presented approach highlights the potential of theoretical analysis of the fine isotopic distribution, which allows modeling the data more accurately, aiming to support the successful experimental measurements.},

  ABSTRACT = {Motivation: The determination of the molecular formula is one of the earliest and most important steps when investigating the chemical nature of an unknown compound. Common approaches use the isotopic pattern of a compound measured using mass spectrometry. Computational methods to determine the molecular formula from this isotopic pattern require a fixed set of elements. Considering all possible elements severely increases running times and more importantly the chance for false positive identifications as the number of candidate formulas for a given target mass rises significantly if the constituting elements are not pre-filtered. This negative effect grows stronger for compounds of higher molecular mass as the effect of a single atom on the overall isotopic pattern grows smaller. On the other hand, hand-selected restrictions on this set of elements may prevent the identification of the correct molecular formula. Thus, it is a crucial step to determine the set of elements most likely comprising the compound prior to the assignment of an elemental formula to an exact mass. Results: In this paper, we present a method to determine the presence of certain elements (sulfur, chlorine, bromine, boron and selenium) in the compound from its (high mass accuracy) isotopic pattern. We limit ourselves to biomolecules, in the sense of products from nature or synthetic products with potential bioactivity. The classifiers developed here predict the presence of an element with a very high sensitivity and high specificity. We evaluate classifiers on three real-world datasets with 663 isotope patterns in total: 184 isotope patterns containing sulfur, 187 containing chlorine, 14 containing bromine, one containing boron, one containing selenium. In no case do we make a false negative prediction; for chlorine, bromine, boron, and selenium, we make ten false positive predictions in total. We also demonstrate the impact of our method on the identification of molecular formulas, in particular the number of considered candidates and running time.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mass spectrometry is commonly applied to qualitatively and quantitatively profile small molecules, such as peptides, metabolites, or lipids. Modern mass spectrometers provide accurate measurements of mass-to-charge ratios of ions, with errors as low as 1 ppm. Even such high mass accuracy, however, is not sufficient to determine the unique chemical formula of each ion, and additional algorithms are necessary. Here we present a universal software tool for predicting chemical formulas from high-resolution mass spectrometry data, developed within the MZmine 2 framework. The tool is based on the use of a combination of heuristic techniques, including MS/MS fragmentation analysis and isotope pattern matching. The performance of the tool was evaluated using a real metabolomic data set obtained with the Orbitrap MS detector. The true formula was correctly determined as the highest-ranking candidate for 79\% of the tested compounds. The novel isotope pattern-scoring algorithm outperformed a previously published method in 64\% of the tested Orbitrap spectra. The software described in this manuscript is freely available and its source code can be accessed within the MZmine 2 source code repository.},

@ARTICLE{jaitly06robust,
  ABSTRACT = {Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become a standard technique for analyzing complex peptide mixtures to determine composition and relative abundance. Several high-throughput proteomics techniques attempt to combine complementary results from multiple LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analyses to provide more comprehensive and accurate results. To effectively collate and use results from these techniques, variations in mass and elution time measurements between related analyses need to be corrected using algorithms designed to align the various types of data: LC-MS/MS versus LC-MS/MS, LC-MS versus LC-MS/MS, and LC-MS versus LC-MS. Described herein are new algorithms referred to collectively as liquid chromatography-based mass spectrometric warping and alignment of retention times of peptides (LCMSWARP), which use a dynamic elution time warping approach similar to traditional algorithms that correct for variations in LC elution times using piecewise linear functions. LCMSWARP is compared to the equivalent approach based upon linear transformation of elution times. LCMSWARP additionally corrects for temporal drift in mass measurement accuracies. We also describe the alignment of LC-MS results and demonstrate their application to the alignment of analyses from different chromatographic systems, showing the suitability of the present approach for more complex transformations.},

  ABSTRACT = {Mass measurement is the main outcome of mass spectrometry-based proteomics yet the potential of recent advances in accurate mass measurements remains largely unexploited. There is not even a clear definition of mass accuracy in the proteomics literature, and we identify at least three uses of this term: anecdotal mass accuracy, statistical mass accuracy, and the maximum mass deviation (MMD) allowed in a database search. We suggest using the second of these terms as the generic one. To make the best use of the mass precision offered by modern instruments we propose a series of simple steps involving recalibration of the data on "internal standards" contained in every proteomics data set. Each data set should be accompanied by a plot of mass errors from which the appropriate MMD can be chosen. More advanced uses of high mass accuracy include an MMD that depends on the signal abundance of each peptide. Adapting search engines to high mass accuracy in the MS/MS data is also a high priority. Proper use of high mass accuracy data can make MS-based proteomics one of the most "digital" and accurate post-genomics disciplines.},

@ARTICLE{boecker16fragmentation,
  ABSTRACT = {Untargeted metabolomics commonly uses liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to measure abundances of metabolites; subsequent tandem mass spectrometry is used to derive information about individual compounds. One of the bottlenecks in this experimental setup is the interpretation of fragmentation spectra to accurately and efficiently identify compounds. Fragmentation trees have become a powerful tool for the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data of small molecules. These trees are determined from the data using combinatorial optimization, and aim at explaining the experimental data via fragmentation cascades. Fragmentation tree computation does not require spectral or structural databases. To obtain biochemically meaningful trees, one needs an elaborate optimization function (scoring). We present a new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial optimization into a Maximum A Posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the superiority of the new scoring for two tasks: Both for the de novo identification of molecular formulas of unknown compounds, and for searching a database for structurally similar compounds, our method SIRIUS 3, performs significantly better than the previous version of our method, as well as other methods for this task. SIRIUS 3 can be a part of an untargeted metabolomics workflow, allowing researchers to investigate unknowns using automated computational methods.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{duehrkop18heuristic,
  ABSTRACT = {In metabolomics, small molecules are structurally elucidated using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS); this computational task can be formulated as the Maximum Colorful Subtree problem, which is NP-hard. Unfortunately, data from a single metabolite requires us to solve hundreds or thousands of instances of this problem---and in a single Liquid Chromatography MS/MS run, hundreds or thousands of metabolites are measured. Here, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of several heuristic algorithms for the problem. Unfortunately, as is often the case in bioinformatics, the structure of the (chemically) true solution is not known to us; therefore we can only evaluate against the optimal solution of an instance. Evaluating the quality of a heuristic based on scores can be misleading: Even a slightly suboptimal solution can be structurally very different from the optimal solution, but it is the structure of a solution and not its score that is relevant for the downstream analysis. To this end, we propose a different evaluation setup: Given a set of candidate instances of which exactly one is known to be correct, the heuristic in question solves each instance to the best of its ability, producing a score for each instance, which is then used to rank the instances. We then evaluate whether the correct instance is ranked highly by the heuristic. We find that one particular heuristic consistently ranks the correct instance in a top position. We also find that the scores of the best heuristic solutions are very close to the optimal score; in contrast, the structure of the solutions can deviate significantly from the optimal structures. Integrating the heuristic allowed us to speed up computations in practice by a factor of 100-fold.},

  ABSTRACT = {Fragmentation trees are a technique for identifying molecular formulas and deriving some chemical properties of metabolites---small organic molecules---solely from mass spectral data. Computing these trees involves finding exact solutions to the NP-hard Maximum Colorful Subtree problem. Existing solvers struggle to solve the large instances involved fast enough to keep up with instrument throughput, and their performance remains a hindrance to adoption in practice. We attack this problem on two fronts: by combining fast and effective reduction algorithms with a strong integer linear program (ILP) formulation of the problem, we achieve overall speedups of 9.4 fold and 8.8 fold on two sets of real-world problems---without sacrificing optimality. Both approaches are, to our knowledge, the first of their kind for this problem. We also evaluate the strategy of solving global problem instances, instead of first subdividing them into many candidate instances as has been done in the past.

  ABSTRACT = {In metabolomics and other fields dealing with small compounds, mass spectrometry is applied as sensitive high-throughput technique. Recently, fragmentation trees have been proposed to automatically analyze the fragmentation mass spectra recorded by such instruments. Computationally, this leads to the problem of finding a maximum weight subtree in an edge weighted and vertex colored graph, such that every color appears at most once in the solution. We introduce new heuristics and an exact algorithm for this Maximum Colorful Subtree problem, and evaluate them against existing algorithms on real-world datasets. Our tree completion heuristic consistently scores better than other heuristics, while the integer programming-based algorithm produces optimal trees with modest running times. Our fast and accurate heuristic can help to determine molecular formulas based on fragmentation trees. On the other hand, optimal trees from the integer linear program are useful if structure is relevant, e.g., for tree alignments.},

  ABSTRACT = {MOTIVATION: Metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra is an important problem in metabolomics, underpinning subsequent metabolic modelling and network analysis. Yet, currently this task requires matching the observed spectrum against a database of reference spectra originating from similar equipment and closely matching operating parameters, a condition that is rarely satisfied in public repositories. Furthermore, the computational support for identification of molecules not present in reference databases is lacking. Recent efforts in assembling large public mass spectral databases such as MassBank have opened the door for the development of a new genre of metabolite identification methods. RESULTS: We introduce a novel framework for prediction of molecular characteristics and identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra using machine learning with the support vector machine (SVM). Our approach is to first predict a large set of molecular properties of the unknown metabolite from salient tandem mass spectral signals, and in the second step to use the predicted properties for matching against large molecule databases, such as PubChem. We demonstrate that several molecular properties can be predicted to high accuracy, and that they are useful in de novo metabolite identification, where the reference database does not contain any spectra of the same molecule.

Machine learning methods has been used to map mass spectra to molecular fingerprints; predicted fingerprints, in turn, can be used to score candidate molecular structures.

  ABSTRACT = {Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of 'privileged' substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial.Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed 'underprivileged' substructures and 'conditional privilege'-rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.},

Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling.

While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},

  ABSTRACT = {The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (www.hmdb.ca) is a resource dedicated to providing scientists with the most current and comprehensive coverage of the human metabolome. Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600\% increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the HMDB, which was previously featured in the 2009 NAR Database Issue. (Note to referees, HMDB 3.0 will go live on 18 September 2012.).},

  ABSTRACT = {ChEBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) is a database and ontology of chemical entities of biological interest. Over the past few years, ChEBI has continued to grow steadily in content, and has added several new features. In addition to incorporating all user-requested compounds, our annotation efforts have emphasized immunology, natural products and metabolites in many species. All database entries are now 'is_a' classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.},

  ABSTRACT = {The National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program is responsible for the management of the online Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB). HSDB, a part of NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET(®)), is a file of chemical/substance information with one record for each specific chemical or substance, or for a category of chemicals or substances. Like the rest of TOXNET's databases and other resources, HSDB is available online at no cost to global users. HSDB has approximately 5600 chemicals and substances, with a focus on toxicology information and also on human exposure, industrial hygiene, emergency handling procedures, environmental fate, regulatory requirements, and related areas of likely interest to HSDB users. All data are from a core set of books, government documents, technical reports, selected primary journal literature, and other online sources of information, with a goal of linking the HSDB content to as much publicly available information as possible. HSDB's content is peer-reviewed by the Scientific Review Panel, a group of experts in the areas covering the scope of HSDB content. Recent enhancements include the addition of chemical structures to HSDB records, the addition of new subfields such as age groups for human data, more occupational exposure standards, and the addition of information on numerous nanomaterials. Examples of future plans include providing more exposure-related information, e.g., uses of a chemical or substance in consumer products; the addition of information summaries aimed towards consumers and other members of the public wanting to learn about a chemical or substance; more visual content such as diagrams (images) of the pathways of metabolism of a substance; and enhanced search features and navigation.},

@ARTICLE{weber12maconda,
  ABSTRACT = {Mass spectrometry is widely used in bioanalysis, including the fields of metabolomics and proteomics, to simultaneously measure large numbers of molecules in complex biological samples. Contaminants routinely occur within these samples, for example, originating from the solvents or plasticware. Identification of these contaminants is crucial to enable their removal before data analysis, in particular to maintain the validity of conclusions drawn from uni- and multivariate statistical analyses. Although efforts have been made to report contaminants within mass spectra, this information is fragmented and its accessibility is relatively limited. In response to the needs of the bioanalytical community, here we report the creation of an extensive manually well-annotated database of currently known small molecule contaminants. AVAILABILITY: The Mass spectrometry Contaminants Database (MaConDa) is freely available and accessible through all major browsers or by using the MaConDa web service http://www.maconda.bham.ac.uk.

@ARTICLE{caspi14metacyc,
  ABSTRACT = {The MetaCyc database (MetaCyc.org) is a comprehensive and freely accessible database describing metabolic pathways and enzymes from all domains of life. MetaCyc pathways are experimentally determined, mostly small-molecule metabolic pathways and are curated from the primary scientific literature. MetaCyc contains >2100 pathways derived from >37 000 publications, and is the largest curated collection of metabolic pathways currently available. BioCyc (BioCyc.org) is a collection of >3000 organism-specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs), each containing the full genome and predicted metabolic network of one organism, including metabolites, enzymes, reactions, metabolic pathways, predicted operons, transport systems and pathway-hole fillers. Additions to BioCyc over the past 2 years include YeastCyc, a PGDB for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 891 new genomes from the Human Microbiome Project. The BioCyc Web site offers a variety of tools for querying and analysis of PGDBs, including Omics Viewers and tools for comparative analysis. New developments include atom mappings in reactions, a new representation of glycan degradation pathways, improved compound structure display, better coverage of enzyme kinetic data, enhancements of the Web Groups functionality, improvements to the Omics viewers, a new representation of the Enzyme Commission system and, for the desktop version of the software, the ability to save display states.},

@ARTICLE{wang16sharing,
  ABSTRACT = {The potential of the diverse chemistries present in natural products (NP) for biotechnology and medicine remains untapped because NP databases are not searchable with raw data and the NP community has no way to share data other than in published papers. Although mass spectrometry (MS) techniques are well-suited to high-throughput characterization of NP, there is a pressing need for an infrastructure to enable sharing and curation of data. We present Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS; http://gnps.ucsd.edu), an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. In GNPS, crowdsourced curation of freely available community-wide reference MS libraries will underpin improved annotations. Data-driven social-networking should facilitate identification of spectra and foster collaborations. We also introduce the concept of 'living data' through continuous reanalysis of deposited data.},

@ARTICLE{horai10massbank,
  ABSTRACT = {MassBank is the first public repository of mass spectra of small chemical compounds for life sciences (<3000 Da). The database contains 605 electron-ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS(n) data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834 other-MS data of 10,286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS(2) data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS(2) data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS(2) data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS(2) data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23\% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data.},

  ABSTRACT = {PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public repository for information on chemical substances and their biological activities, launched in 2004 as a component of the Molecular Libraries Roadmap Initiatives of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). For the past 11 years, PubChem has grown to a sizable system, serving as a chemical information resource for the scientific research community. PubChem consists of three inter-linked databases, Substance, Compound and BioAssay. The Substance database contains chemical information deposited by individual data contributors to PubChem, and the Compound database stores unique chemical structures extracted from the Substance database. Biological activity data of chemical substances tested in assay experiments are contained in the BioAssay database. This paper provides an overview of the PubChem Substance and Compound databases, including data sources and contents, data organization, data submission using PubChem Upload, chemical structure standardization, web-based interfaces for textual and non-textual searches, and programmatic access. It also gives a brief description of PubChem3D, a resource derived from theoretical three-dimensional structures of compounds in PubChem, as well as PubChemRDF, Resource Description Framework (RDF)-formatted PubChem data for data sharing, analysis and integration with information contained in other databases.},

@ARTICLE{hoffmann19mztab,
  ABSTRACT = {Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the primary techniques used for large-scale analysis of small molecules in metabolomics studies. To date, there has been little data format standardization in this field, as different software packages export results in different formats represented in XML or plain text, making data sharing, database deposition, and reanalysis highly challenging. Working within the consortia of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, Proteomics Standards Initiative, and the Metabolomics Society, we have created mzTab-M to act as a common output format from analytical approaches using MS on small molecules. The format has been developed over several years, with input from a wide range of stakeholders. mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated text format, but importantly, the structure is highly standardized through the design of a detailed specification document, tightly coupled to validation software, and a mandatory controlled vocabulary of terms to populate it. The format is able to represent final quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from MS (e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and different types of approaches used to identify molecules. mzTab-M allows for ambiguity in the identification of molecules to be communicated clearly to readers of the files (both people and software). There are several implementations of the format available, and we anticipate widespread adoption in the field.},
